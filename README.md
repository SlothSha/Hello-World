# Hello-World
This repository is created to understand the github workflow
Hello all!
This is SlothSha, a second year post grad @ Indian Institute Of Technology, Bombay
I created this gitHub account so as to learn a hardware description language along with a high level language so as it helps me for my placements and MTech Project.
That's it for now, if there's any update, I'll come back and update for sure
till then, byebye from slothSha
